Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
1. Select and submit a number rating
2. See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
3. View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
4. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
